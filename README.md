# Parallax-Website

A parallax website includes fixed images in the background that is kept in place and user can scroll down the page to see different parts of the image. In this article, we are creating a parallax webpage using HTML and CSS. We will use basic tags of HTML like div, paragraph, and heading to write our content and will use CSS to align and beautify our basic HTML design.

Approach:

We have used a container element and add a background image to the container. Then we have used the background-attachment: fixed to create the actual parallax effect.
For each HTML section we have given a class so that it can be target in the CSS.
In the HTML page, we have divisions and in each division, there is a header and a small paragraph. In the CSS file, we have decorated our text and placed the head at a fixed position.
